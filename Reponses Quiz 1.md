## Réponses au Quiz 1

### Question 1
Which of the following are steps in building a machine learning algorithm ?
* Training and test sets : NO
* Data mining : NO
* Collecting data to answer the question : YES
* Artificial Intelligence : NO

### Question 2
Suppose we build a prediction algorithm on a data set and it is 100% accurate on that data set. Why might the algorithm not work well if we collect a new data set?
* We may be using a bad algorithm that doesn't predict well on this kind of data : NO		
* We have used neural networks which has notoriously bad performance : NO	
* We may be using bad variables that don't explain the outcome.v : NO	
* Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, predicting both the signal and the noise : YES

### Question 3
What are typical sizes for the training and test sets?
* 60% in the training set, 40% in the testing set : YES
* 10% test set, 90% training set			
* 0% training set, 100% test set	
* 100% training set, 0% test set

### Question 4
What are some common error rates for predicting binary variables (i.e. variables with two possible values like yes/no, disease/normal, clicked/didn't click)?
* Correlation			
* Root mean squared error			
* Predictive value of a positive : YES
* R^2

### Question 5
Suppose that we have created a machine learning algorithm that predicts whether a link will be clicked with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. The rate the link is clicked is 1/1000 of visits to a website. If we predict the link will be clicked on a specific visit, what is the probability it will actually be clicked?
* 90%			
* 89.9%			
* 9% : YES
* 99.9%
