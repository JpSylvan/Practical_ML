The purpose is to predict the variable classe with all the features given by Coursera.
There is a training and a testing data set. The testing data set doesn't contain the variable class, 
so it cannot be use as a test subset. It is only for the purpose of submission. 

First 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
